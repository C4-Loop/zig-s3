//! S3 Client Library for Zig
//!
//! This library provides a simple interface for interacting with Amazon S3 and S3-compatible services.
//! It supports basic operations like creating/deleting buckets and uploading/downloading objects.
//!
//! Basic usage:
//! ```zig
//! const S3Client = @import("s3").S3Client;
//! const S3Config = @import("s3").S3Config;
//!
//! // Initialize client
//! var client = try S3Client.init(allocator, .{
//!     .access_key_id = "your-key",
//!     .secret_access_key = "your-secret",
//!     .region = "us-east-1",
//! });
//! defer client.deinit();
//!
//! // Use the client
//! try client.createBucket("my-bucket");
//! try client.putObject("my-bucket", "hello.txt", "Hello, S3!");
//! ```
